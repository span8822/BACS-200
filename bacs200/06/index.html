        Rats are amazing animals. They are affectionate and intelligent.
        <br>They are even tempered enough for children to be able to handle them (as long as you teach children how to handle animals in general).
        <br>Their scientific name is Rattus Norvegicus Domestica.
        <br>They are different from wild rats, as they are bred to have less diseases and have better temperments.
        <br>They're all around great.

        <h3>Dangers of Technology</h3>
    <p>

        An overuse of technology can lead to mental health issues in teens and adults alike
        <br>An overuse of technology-specifiacally social media-can lead to battling depression and anxiety
        <br>Social media can also lead to self esteem issues
        <br>An increase in instant gratification and need for approval of others can lead to anxiety
        <br>All of these factors are influenced by unrealistic body standards in front of users faces daily,
        <br>a need for constant approval, and depression when these expecations are not lived up to in their own minds.
        <br>
        <br>An over use of technology can also lead to neglect in every day life.
        <br>Using technology too much means it's getting all of your attention, none of it is going towards your real life.
        <br>Real life involves a social life, chores, and work. When you neglect your social life, you are harming your social skills.
        <br>Due to a lack of face-to-face interaction, you are less able to read social cues and tonal cues and are more likely
        <br>to upset yourself or another person. This can lead to a depression from lack of proper socialization.
        <br>When you allow your space to fall to disarray, this can cause your anxiety and stress to spike.
        <br>You'll be so focused on the fact that you need to clean or do some sort of work that you might end up
        <br>putting off all forms of work in order to relax on the device that's causing you to let your space get messy.
        <br>
        <br>Too much technology can also cause sleep issues.
        <br>The blue light emitted from device screens has been known to keep users awake.
        <br>There are filters and technology enhancements to keep the blue light to a minimum, but the mental
        <br>stimulation that comes from actively using something can also keep you from falling asleep.
        <br>With a lack of sleep. the brain can start hallucinating and can cause irritability and depression.
        <br>Also humans can die if they don't get enough sleep. Moral of the story is, you are far more important than your device.
        <br>Take care of yourself.
