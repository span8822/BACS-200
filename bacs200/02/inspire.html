            What makes a hero?  A hero is someone that we look up to.
            Heroes embody what we truly value most.  Therefore who we select as
            role models says a lot about who we are as people.
        </p>
        <p>
            The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Outrageously courageous - they disturb the status quo and define a new normal</li>
            <li>Motivate others - people follow those who inspire</li>
            <li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
            <li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
            <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Out of all of these characteristics, I do not know of any other man that exemplifies them. David Bowie was and still is a musical inspiration. Not only that, he was a fasion icon. His daring choices not only ostracized him from a major group of society, but it allowed the younger generation to feel more accepted in their choices, whether it be personality wise or clothing wise. He helped shape a portion of his generation and more.
