        <h2>Amusement #1: Foxes</h2>
            <img crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Vulpes_vulpes_laying_in_snow.jpg" class="jpg" alt="Red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) lying in snow" style="">
        <p>Foxes amuse me. They are adorable animals that are very crafty and energetic. Whenever I look at videos of domestic foxes and see the havoc they wreak upon their owners, I don't want one, but I do giggle. I used to want a fox, but then I realized my lifestyle doesn't fit the time and energy a fox needs. </p>

        <h2> Amusement #2: Animation </h2>

            <p> Animation is such a hard art to succeed at. Not only does it take your ability to do art into consideration, it also takes the ability to recognize proportions and see how a body or thing moves in real life and translate it into a cartoon form. I can't even draw a stick figure. These people amaze me.</p>

         <h2>Amusement #3: Wood Carving </h2>
            <img class="irc_mi" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/51ba4b_6f340445dd854d0b822c9ced59a486fa~mv2_d_3679_3679_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_280,h_280,fp_0.50_0.50,q_90/51ba4b_6f340445dd854d0b822c9ced59a486fa~mv2_d_3679_3679_s_4_2.jpg" alt="Image result for wood carving" style="" width="280" height="280">
            <p> Wood Carving is absolutely fascinating! You're taking a hunk of wood and some tools and turning the hunk of wood into something that someone wants! It could be something useful or purely decorative. I absolutely love the idea of this. My uncle used to be big into woodworking, until he cut off his left thumb and index finger. That made it a bit hard to woodwork afterwards. </p>
