# BACS-200
I want my pages to show who I am as a person. I want to show that I'm not a college kid who only thinks of business and school. While they're on my mind, I have memes and horrible jokes going through my head. I have songs on rotate and cute fuzzy animals. I want to play and explore more with this class, and that's what this final project is for me.


My Fancy Tricks Are:
Picture carousel on rats.html
Dark mode toggle on music.html
Animated button on cAh.html
Text when hovering over picture on fancytricks.html
Typewriter effect at bottom of fancytricks.html
