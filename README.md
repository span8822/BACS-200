# BACS-200
I want my pages to show who I am as a person. I want to show that I'm not a college kid who only thinks of business and school. While they're on my mind, I have memes and horrible jokes going through my head. I have songs on rotate and cute fuzzy animals. I want to play and explore more with this class, and that's what this final project is for me.
